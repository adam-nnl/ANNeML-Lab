ANNeML-Lab can be used to open existing ANNeML XML files and randomize weights and biases. It also has a dialog-based 
wizard that creates neural networks.

==========

To open an existing ANNeML file for editing(randomization) click the browse button or select the file name from the drop down if it has been
opened previously. Once the file is opened click the Randomize button and then the Save File button to save the now randomized
neural network.

To create a new ANNeML file click the ANNeML Wizard button and answer the dialog prompts. The main network layout and options
will be generated from your responses. For any extra or optional attributes, etc. you will have to open the ANNeML XML file
after completing the wizard and add them in by hand.
